# Question: {RNHR} on a ketone with two alpha hydrogens does this
# Answer: replaces O with {NR2}, and creates a double bond between
# the carbonyl carbon and alpha carbon

Question: Kinetic enolate pi bond forms here
Answer: between carbonyl carbon and less substituted alpha carbon

Question: Thermodynamic enolate pi bond forms here
Answer: between carbonyl carbon and more substituted alpha carbon

Question: why does the thermodynamic enolate form with a weak base in a
protic solvent?
Answer: the double bond to a more substituted carbon is more stable

Question: why does the kinetic enolate form with a strong sterically
hindered base?
Answer: the sterically hindered base removes the less hindered proton
faster

Question: type of reagent to form thermodynamic enolate
Answer: weak base in a protic solvent

Question: type of reagent to form kinetic enolate
Answer: strong, non-nucleophilic, sterically hindered base

Question: specific reagent to form kinetic enolate
Answer: {LDA} and {THF}

Question: rate limiting step of acid-catalyzed enolation
Answer: deprotonation of alpha carbon

Question: rate limiting step of base-catalyzed enolation
Answer: deprotonation of alpha carbon

Question: steps in mechanism of acid-catalyzed enol formation
Answer: protonate oxygen then deprotonate alpha carbon

Question: steps in mechanism of base-catalyzed enol formation
Answer: deprotonate alpha carbon then protonate oxygen with acid

Question: reagents for haloform reaction
Answer: {OH-} and {X2}

Question: condition for multiple halogen additions to methyl ketone
Answer: there must be a base present

Question: why will compounds with a hydrogen alpha to carbonyl be
acidic?
Answer: stability of ion

Question: keto and enol forms are these kinds of isomers
Answer: tautomers, or constitutional isomers that are in equilibrium
with each other

Question: what is an epimer?
Answer: a diastereomer in which only one stereocenter is racemized

Question: a beta keto ester has this property
Answer: two carbonyls that are at beta positions relative to each other

Question: what is an active hydrogen compound?
Answer: generally, a compound that has two electron withdrawing groups
attached to the same carbon atom

Question: what happens if you try to add a secondary or tertiary alkyl
via direct alkylation?
Answer: the enolate acts as a base instead of a nucleophile and forms
elimination products

# Question: where is the most electrophilic place on an acid halide?
# Answer: the carbonyl

Question: these carboxylic acids decarboxylate readily
Answer: beta keto acids

Question: what are the two ways a beta keto acid can decarboxylate?
Answer: through a six-membered cyclic transition state, which avoids an
anionic intermediate, or by forming a resonance-stabilized anion

Question: carboxylic acids exist in solution as these
Answer: dimers

Question: why do carboxylic acids exist in solution as dimers?
Answer: they make strong hydrogen bonds with other carboxylic acids

Question: why do carboxylic acids have a higher boiling point than
{ROH}?
Answer: because of their strong hydrogen bonds

Question: why are carboxylic acids relatively soluble in water?
Answer: because of their strong hydrogen bonds

Question: what is a carboxylate?
Answer: the salt formed from the loss of a proton from a carboxylic acid

Question: How many carbons long must a carboxylate be to be very soluble
in water?
Answer: 6 carbons long

Question: why is an acid chloride more reactive than an ester or an
amide?
Answer: the ester and amide have better resonance structures and are
therefore more stable

Question: what are the steps in the mechanism for formation of an acid
chloride from a carboxylic acid using {SOCl2}?
Answer: one: oxygen in {OH} group attacks sulfer.  two: chlorine leaves.
three: chlorine grabs a hydrogen from {OH}.  four: chlorine addition at
carbonyl.  five: reformation of carbonyl and elimination of leaving
group

Question: what are the steps in the mechanism for formation of an ester
from an acid chloride using {ROH} and a base?
Answer: one: {ROH} is added to carbonyl.  two: {ROH} is deprotonated by
the base.  three: carbonyl is reformed and chlorine anion is eliminated

Question: one needs at least this many equivalents {RNH2} to make an
amide from an acid chloride
Answer: 2 equivalents

Question: why is it not feasible to form an amide using a tertiary
amine?
Answer: the tertiary amide is not stable

Question: a cyclic anhydride of this size can be formed by dehydration
Answer: a five or six membered ring

Question: what are the steps in the mechanism of formation of an ester
from an anhydride?
Answer: one: protonate one of the carbonyl oxygens.  two: addition of
{ROH} to the carbonyl.  three: multiple proton transfers.  four:
elimination of a carboxylate.

Question: what is a lactone?
Answer: a lactone is a cyclic ester

Question: name for a lactone with four carbons in the ring
Answer: 4-butanolactone or 8-butyroactone

Question: name for a lactone with five carbons in the ring
Answer: 5-pentanolactone or 8-valeroactone

Question: name for a lactone with six carbons in the ring
Answer: 6-hexanolactone or epsilon-caprolactone

Question: name of the reaction to oxidizde a ketone to form an ester
Answer: Baeyer-Villiger oxidation

Question: why is it necessary to remove water to drive a Fischer
esterification?
Answer: {RCOOH} and {RCOOR'} are the same reactivity

Question: what are the steps in the mechanism for Fischer
esterification?
Answer: protonate, attack with ROH, protonate to make a good leaving
group, reform the carbonyl, and finally, deprotonate

Question: reagents to make a methyl ester from a carboxylic acid
Answer: {CH2N2}, also known as diazomethane

Question: product of reaction of carboxylic acid with diazomethane
Answer: methyl ester and nitrogen gas

Question: what is another word for hydrolysis of an ester?
Answer: saponification

Question: what is saponification?
Answer: hydrolysis of an ester

Question: what is base-catalyzed saponification used for?
Answser: it is used to make soaps

Question: what is the order of speed of reaction between an methyl
ester, an isopropyl ester, and a t-butyl ester?
Answer: the methyl ester is the fastest, then the isopropyl ester, then
the t-butyl ester

Question: why can acid not be used to convert an ester to an amide?
Answer: {H+} would protonate the amine

Question: what is the byproduct in synthesis of an amide from a
carboxylic acid?
Answer: urea

Question: what product is formed when an amide is hydrated?
Answer: a carboxylic acid

Question: what product is formed when an amide is dehydrated?
Answer: a nitrile

Question: what product is formed when an amide is reduced?
Answer: an amine

Question: what kind of reaction occurs between cyanide and an alkyl
halide?
Answer: substitution

Question: what product is formed when a nitrile is hydrated?
Answer: a carboxylic acid (using {H3O+}, or {OH-} and {H2O} followed by
{H3O+}), or an amide (using concentrated {H2SO4} followed by a weak
base)

Question: what product is formed when a nitrile is reduced?
Answer: an amine (using {LAH} followed by an {H+} workup), or an
aldehyde (using DIBAL-H followed by {H3O+}).

Question: why is carbonic acid highly unstable?
Answer: it has a high oxidation state

Question: what process naturally occurs to carbonic acid?
Answer: decarboxylation, which forms {CO2} and {H2O}

Queston: what is phosgene?
Answer: a derivative of carbonic acid in which both {OH} groups are
replaced by {Cl}

Question: product of phosgene plus {R'OH} plus {R''OH}
Answer: three different ester products

Question: product of phosgene plus {R'NH2} and {R''OH}
Answer: {R'HN}, C double bond O, {OR''}

Question: product of phosgene plus two equivalents of {RNH2}
Answer: urea

Question: what is carbamate used for
Answer: as an amide protecting group

Question: why will a dicarboxylic acid decarboxylate instead of forming
an anhydride, when heat is applied?
Answer: to form an anhydride, it would have to form a 4-membered ring
